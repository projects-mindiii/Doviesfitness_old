    <string name="create_information"><![CDATA[<html><body style:"font-size: 11.0pt !important; font-family: TamilSangamMN !important;line-height:10.0pt;"><p>Welcome to workout creation.<br>This page is going to explain how to create a workout.</br>
    <p>Every star sign ( * ) needs to be filled.</p></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">PHOTO</font>  </strong><br>You add a picture to give the workout details nice look.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">WORKOUT NAME</font></strong><br>You add the name so you can differentiate between other workouts.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">LEVEL</font></strong><br>Select the type of level you are creating. So if you send it to someone, they will
            know how challenging or easy the workout is.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">OVERVIEW</font></strong><br>This field is where you
            can write more information about the workout you are creating. You can add in additional details regarding
            equipment and even writing a personal message if you are sending this to someone. For personal trainers, this field is good to
            add any other suggestions and alternative equipment for clients. Also, you can write your weights you going to use in this field as well.
            So you can track your equipment weights during lifting.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">GOOD FOR</font></strong><br>There is a list of what most workouts
            are good for. You can select what the workout you are creating is good for so that if you share it with your friends, family or clients,
            they will have an idea right away what the workout is going to do for them.  For example if your workout is good for abs just select abs.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">EQUIPMENT</font></strong><br>There is a list of workout equipment listed. Select which one you are going to create the workout with. For example,
            if you have a dumbbell and you want to create a workout with it you can select that and then when you go to the exercise library
            you can filter the library with all dumbbell workouts. If you don\'t know the equipment you can leave this part and add all
            your exercise and then after that you can check the exercise demonstration you have added to your workout to see what equipment
            is involved and then you can add them to the <strong><font color="#ffffff">EQUIPMENT</font></strong> section. This is to help others get an idea of what
                equipment they are going to need for the workout you created.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">DEFAULT SETTING FOR TIME AND REPS</font></strong><br> The default settings are there to make it easier for you to create your workout faster. We have currently put in a default timer and Reps settings for you.
            We have set 30 seconds for <strong><font color="#ffffff">TIMER</font></strong> exercises, 10 reps for <strong><font color="#ffffff">REPETITION</font></strong> exercise and 30 seconds for the
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">TIME</font></strong> to finish that <strong><font color="#ffffff">10 REPS</font></strong> exercise. Each rep number you chose needs time you going to use to finish
                it so chose the right time for reps exercises.</br><br>You can change the settings if you don\'t like the default setting.
            If you want to do 1 min for your timer exercise or 12 reps for repetition, you can set it as your default settings.
            Our setting is set up in a way to help you if you forget to set your own time or reps.  If you don’t change
            this setting before you add your exercises, you will have our default settings, that means every exercise you
                add will have 30 seconds for Timer or 10 reps for reps exercises and 30 second time to finish that reps.</br><br>If you make a mistake in your default settings before you add your exercise don\'t panic you can go back to the
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">DEFAULT SETTINGS</font></strong> and change it then go to the exercise and select <strong><font color="#ffffff">REPS</font></strong> and then switch it back to
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">TIME</font></strong>, the new setting will auto-fill for that exercise. But in this case, you will have to do it manually by selection
            one exercise at a time. If you add your exercises and you decide to change the default settings, the new setting is
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">NOT</font></strong> going to change all the already added exercises automatically. But any new exercise you add will pick the
                current settings. All previous exercises you have already added must be changed manually.</br></p><p>Note that once you add your exercise after setting default time and reps. All the exercises will be select as
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">TIME</font></strong>. So if you want to do <strong><font color="#ffffff">REPS</font></strong>, then you have to select the
            <strong><font color="#ffffff">REPS.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">REST TIME:</font></strong><br>Any time you add an exercise, you will see a rest time.
            If you decide you want to add a rest time after every exercise then you have to add the time manually. You can\'t set default rest time.
            </br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">DELETING AND DUPLICATION</font></strong><br> Once you add an exercise, you will see a red icon on the thumbnail image.
            That is the delete icon, and the green icon is for Duplication. If you want to repeat the same exercise you can click the duplication icon,
            and it will copy the time or reps, and you can move it around.  During workout creation, you can also preview the video as well in case you
            want to double check the exercise to give it a correct time or reps. You can also press and hold on exercise to move it up or down.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">UNDERSTANDING  REP TIME</font></strong><br>Each rep time you set will still play as a timer during the player mode, and after
            the time you set to finish the reps chosen is done, it will go to next exercise. So make sure you set a time you believe you can
            complete the specific exercise. If you think you can do 10 reps of squats in 30 seconds, then select 30 seconds.
            Every workout on the app is an interval timer workout. When the time reach, it goes to next automatically.
            Unless you pause or go back to previews exercise.</br></p><p><strong><font color="#ffffff">TOTAL WORKOUT TIME</font></strong><br>All the time you put in your exercise is going to add up to get the total time for the workout you are creating.
            So if you add 5 exercises without rest time and each exercise is 1 min, your entire workout time will be 5 minutes.
            You can check your total workout time with the time icon on your right before you save your workout.
            That will help you know the duration of the workout you are creating. Workout time doesn\'t add seconds when you save it.
            So if you create for example 1min 10 seconds, it will save as 1min, but when you are playing your workout,
            it will play all 1min 10 seconds. We did this to give the <strong><font color="#ffffff">TOTAL TIME</font></strong> in workout details simple look.
            You can check the workout collection and see how the workouts have been created to provide you with an understanding of how to
                create your own.</br></p><p>For more information, you can also go to our website
